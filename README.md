## Thermodynamically Consistent Recurrent Neural Networks (TCRNN)
This repository provides the TCRNN model presented in the paper *Thermodynamically Consistent Machine-Learned Internal State Variable Approach for Data-Driven Modeling of Path-Dependent Materials*, which proposes a machine-learned physics-informed data-driven constitutive modeling approach for path-dependent materials based on the measurable material states. The proposed data-driven constitutive model is designed with the consideration of universal thermodynamics principles, where the internal state variables (ISVs) essential to the material path-dependency are inferred automatically from the hidden state of RNNs. The RNN describing the evolution of the data-driven machine-learned ISVs follows the thermodynamics second law. To enhance the robustness and accuracy of RNN models, stochasticity is introduced to model training.
